      <p class="lead">
        Hello! I’m <strong>Syed Minhaj</strong>, currently pursuing my Master’s degree in <strong>Data Analytics</strong> in the <strong>United States of America</strong>. This project is a student management system developed using <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong>. It covers complete data tracking for students, courses, enrollments, and performance results.

A student management system is a fundamental component of educational institutions that helps streamline administrative and academic tasks by maintaining organized, efficient, and accessible records of students, teachers, courses, enrollments, and results. To facilitate this, relational databases are used, with well-designed tables forming the backbone of the system. These tables allow educational institutions to efficiently store, update, and retrieve information, ensuring smooth operation and data integrity. At the core of any student management system are five essential tables: `students`, `teachers`, `courses`, `enrollments`, and `results`.

The `students` table holds detailed information about each student, including their unique ID, full name, date of birth, and email address. This table acts as the primary source for identifying and managing student data. Similarly, the `teachers` table stores the credentials of the teaching staff, including a unique ID, name, and contact email. This helps in assigning faculty to specific courses and managing teacher-specific responsibilities.

The <mark>`courses`</mark> table outlines all the academic subjects offered by the institution. It typically includes a course ID, course name, and a foreign key referencing the teacher responsible for the course. This connection between the `courses` and `teachers` tables enforces relational integrity and ensures that every course is linked to a valid instructor.

The <mark>`enrollments`</mark> table serves as a bridge between the `students` and `courses` tables. It records which student is enrolled in which course and the date of enrollment. Each entry includes a unique enrollment ID, student ID, course ID, and the enrollment date. This many-to-many relationship enables the system to handle complex scenarios where students can enroll in multiple courses and each course can have many students.

To track academic performance, the <mark>`results`</mark> table is used.
